## Setup

1. Prerequisites:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
   - A [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) account for map functionality
   - A [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) account for SMS capabilities

2. Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```python
   RECEIVER_PHONE_NUMBER=your_phone_number
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_number
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
   ```

3. Mapbox Configuration:
   - Obtain a Mapbox access token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
   - Replace `REPLACE_ME__BUDDY` in `src/routes/+page.svelte` with your Mapbox token

4. And we're almost done!
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. If you want to use it on your ðŸ“± phone:
    - Easiest way would be to host it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (**NOT AFFILIATED**).
    - then open the site on your phone (i.e. `https://gpeaoihganebo.vercel.app`).

## Configuration details
- `RECEIVER_PHONE_NUMBER`: The phone number that will receive SMS notifications. Make sure it starts with the receiver's country code, i.e. `+1xxxxx` for the US.
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Your Twilio-provided phone number for sending SMS.
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio account SID.
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio authentication token.
